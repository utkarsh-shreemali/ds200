This repository contains plots of three different types ( Scatter plot, Box plot and Bar plot ) on dataset of rice production in various states of India available at https://data.gov.in under the link "https://data.gov.in/resources/state-wise-production-rice-2010-11-2014-15-ministry-agriculture-and-farmers-welfare". This dataset contains the data on average rice production in Indian states during the time period 2010-2015.

The Scatter plot is plotted between the Average Rice Production on the y-axis and the states on the x-axis.

The box plot is gives us an indication of the maximum, minimum and median of the amount of rice produced in India for the time period 2010-2015. It also gives us an idea of the amount of rice produced by most of the states indicated by the box in the graph.

The bar plot allows us to compare the production of various states clearly. We see that West Bengal is the largest producer of rice in India whereas Himachal Pradesh is the smallest producer of rice.
